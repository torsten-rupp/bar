BAR - BAckup aRchiver

BAR is backup archiver program. It can create compressed and
encrypted archives of files which can be stored on a harddisk,
cd or dvd or directly on a server via ftp, scp or sftp. A
server-mode and a scheduler is integrated for making automated
backups in the background.

--- Features

* can split archive files into pieces
* compress of data with zlib, bzip2 or lzma algorithms
* encryption with gcrypt algrithms (AES,TWOFISH etc.)
* asymmetric encryption with RSA
* fast file format: can find and extract single files
  without decompressing/decryption of the whole archive
* direct copy of archives to remote computer via FTP or
  SSH (SCP or SFTP)
* can store archives on DVD (with external tools)
* support pre- and post-processing of DVD images (e. g.
  for including functions of dvdisaster)
* daemon-mode with control over plain and TSL network
  connection
* nice graphical frontend (written in Java+SWT)

--- Installation

If there is no binary package available for your system, you
can compile bar by yourself. The following additional packages
are mandatory:

* http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz

The following additional packages are optional:

* http://www.bzip.org/1.0.5/bzip2-1.0.5.tar.gz
* http://tukaani.org/xz/xz-4.999.8beta.tar.gz
* ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/libgpg-error-1.7.tar.bz2
* ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.4.4.tar.bz2
* ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.8.1.tar.bz2
* http://www.nbpfaus.net/~pfau/ftplib/ftplib-3.1-src.tar.gz
* http://nbpfaus.net/~pfau/ftplib/ftplib-3.1-1.patch
* http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libssh2/libssh2-1.1.tar.gz?download

There are two ways to use the additional packages:

1a)

Extract the archives and place links in the bar build
directory before executing bar configure:

zlib:
  http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz

  ln -s zlib-1.2.3 zlib

bzip2:
  http://www.bzip.org/1.0.5/bzip2-1.0.5.tar.gz

  ln -s bzip2-1.0.5 bzip2

lzma:
  http://tukaani.org/xz/xz-4.999.8beta.tar.gz

  ln -s xz-4.999.8beta xz

gcrypt:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/libgpg-error-1.7.tar.bz2
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.4.4.tar.bz2

  ln -s libgpg-error-1.7 libgpg
  ln -s libgcrypt-1.4.4 libgcrypt

gnutls:
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.8.1.tar.bz2

  ln -s gnutls-2.8.1 gnutls

ftplib:
  http://www.nbpfaus.net/~pfau/ftplib/ftplib-3.1-src.tar.gz
  http://nbpfaus.net/~pfau/ftplib/ftplib-3.1-1.patch

  cd ftplib-3.1; patch -p3 < ftplib-3.1-1.patch; cd ..
  ln -s ftplib-3.1 ftplib

ssh2:
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libssh2/libssh2-1.1.tar.gz?download

  ln -s sshftplib-3.1 ftplib

You can execute the supplied script to download (wget required) all
additional packages, extract them to a temporary directory and set the
required links for bar: 

  download-third-party-packages.sh

Note: bar configure will build the additional packages into a temporary
      directory and link the libraries statically.

1b)

Install the additional packages on the system:

zlib:
  http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz

  tar xjf zlib-1.2.3.tar.bz2
  cd zlib-1.2.3
  ./configure
  make
  make install

  ldconfig

  cd libssh2-1.1
  ./configure
  patch -p1 < <BAR source directory>/misc/libssh2-1.1-keepalive.patch
  make
  make install

  ldconfig

  Notes: - newer versions of libssh2 already include the seek-patch.
         - the keepalive patch is optional

1c)

On a Debian system you can use the following packages:

  gcc
  zlib
  zlib1g-dev
  libbz2-dev
  libssl-dev
  libssh2-1-dev
  libgcrypt11-dev
  libgnutls-dev
  gnutls-bin
  openjdk-6-jdk
  make
  epm

  Note: the xz utils may not be available a Debian package current.

2)

Then compile and install BAR with:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

--- Compression

For compression zip, bzip2 or lzma can be used. The compression
algorithms offer different levels of compression ration and time.
The following values give a rough impression for compression of
some arbitary data:

Type    Size   Ratio
--------------------------
Orignal 764M   -
zip9    261M   65.9%
bzip9   259M   66.1%
lzma9   214M   72.0%

The compression of lzma9 is better than for zip9 or bzip9, but
the compression time is also increased significantly.

--- Archive files and encryption

For encryption the algorithms of the gcrypt library are used.
The BAR archive files are not encrypted in a single block,
instead each stored file is encrypted. The archive file
structure is readable (an BAR archive is organized in
"chunks"; see archiv_format.def if you are interested in
details), thus everybody can detect e. g. how many files are
stored in the archive, but nobody except the owner of the
passphrase used for encryption can read the contents of the
files nor the file meta data, e. g. file names (as long as the
used encryption algorithm is not broken by someone).

For asymmetric encryption a pair of keys with hybrit
encryption is used: the file meta data and file data is
encrypted with a symmetric algorithmis, e. g. AES or Twofish.
The key for symmetric encryption is chosen from random data,
encrypted asymmetric with the public key and stored in the BAR
archive files, too. Those archives can only be read when the
private key is available to decrypt the symmetric key. With
asymmetric encryption BAR archives can be created without
knowledge of the password needed for decryption.

--- Storage on a DVD

For storing archive files on DVD an external program like
"growisofs" is needed which is actually writing data to a DVD.
BAR create the archive files in a temporary directory and then
call the external tool for burning the DVD. The tool
"growisofs" is recommented for storing archive files directly
on DVD. An ISO image can also be created first e. g. with
mkisofs. BAR support external pre- and post-processing
commands when creating an ISO-image and burning a DVD. With
these commands e. g. dvdisaster can be integrated into BAR to
create RS-protected backup DVDs.

The following external tools are needed with the default
settings of BAR to create an DVD:

- growisofs
- mkisofs
- dvdisaster
- eject
- nice

--- Graphical frontend

barcontrol is a graphical user interface for BAR. It is
written in Java with SWT (Note: the former version used
TclTk). To run the graphical user interface a Java
runtime environment V1.5 (JDK5) or newer is required.
To start the graphical user interface type in

  java -jar barcontrol-linux.jar

resp. (if jar is packed with launch4j into an .exe)

  barcontrol.exe

resp.

  java -jar barcontrol-windows.jar


barcontrol ask for BAR server and the login password and then
connect to the running BAR server either via TLS or a plain
socket connection. barcontrol can edit jobs on a server,
display the current status of jobs and start or stop jobs.

To use barcontrol the BAR server daemon have to be
startet first. Either enter

  bar --daemon

or use the start-script 'barserver' from /etc/init.d.

Please note that for a TLS connection the TSL keys and
cerificate files have to be available.

Note: If you want to use a ssh tunnel to connect to the bar
      server connect the ssh tunnel to port number 38523
      (plain connection) or 38524 (TLS connenction).

Install Java, SWT, launch4j:

* Download Java JRE V1.5 (JRE5) from http://www.sun.com
* Install Java

In case you do not want to use the included SWT 3.4
in barcontrol-linux.jar or barcontrol-windows.jar and
use instead barcontrol.jar SWT have to be installed:

* Download SWT from http://www.eclipse.org/swt
* Install SWT to some directory

To start barcontrol with the installed SWT you have to
specify the path to the swt.jar file, e. g.

  java -classpath /usr/local/swt/swt.jar:barcontrol.jar BARControl

If a single executable file should be created the
barcontrol jar file can be wrapped with launch4j:

* Download launch4j from http://launch4j.sourceforge.net
* Install

Note: call configure with

  --with-launchj4-dir=<path>
