Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: Can I build a static linked version of BAR?
A: Yes. Use --enable-link-static when calling configure. The
   resulting binary is linked static with all needed
   libraries except libc, libm and libpthread.

Q: Can I create incremental archives even the file system does
   not have an "archive" bit?
A: Yes. BAR create his own incremental list files (.bid files).
   These list files contain information which are used to check
   which files changed.

Q: Can I just create the incremental list file?
A: Yes. Use option --no-storage. The incremental list file is
   created, but no archive files are neither created nor stored.
