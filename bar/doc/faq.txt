Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: Why is BAR linked static?
A: BAR is not fully linked static, but partially. All needed
   libraries are linked static except libc, libm and libpthread.
   The advantage of this type of linkage is that BAR can be
   executed on many systems, even when some specific libraries
   like libraries for compression or encryption are not
   available on the target system. BAR can also be started from
   a CD or DVD without installation.

Q: Can I build a dynamic linked version of BAR?
A: Yes. Use --enable-link-dynamic when calling configure. The
   resulting binary is linked dynamic.

Q: Can I create incremental archives even the file system does
   not have an "archive" bit?
A: Yes. BAR create his own incremental list files (.bid files).
   These list files contain information which are used to check
   which files changed.

Q: Can I just create the incremental list file?
A: Yes. Use option --no-storage and --create-incremental-list.
   The incremental list file is created, but no archive files
   are neither created nor stored.

Q: I cannot establish a TLS/SSL connection with barcontrol.
A: For the TLS/SSL connection in barcontrol a TLS/SSL key
   is required. Create that key once with "make keys" and
   copy the keys with "make install_keys" in the appropiapted
   directories of your system.

Q: I tried to list a *.bid-file, but it does not show anything.
A: The .bid-files are not archive files, but files with lists
   of files names needed for the incremental backup. Do not
   modified, delete or copy those files. The content is not
   encrypted. There is no need to e. g. storage them on an
   external server.

Q: When I specify "-# /foo/" the list of included files is
   different to "-# /foo". Why?
A: The options values for -# and -! are patterns, not file or
   directory names. "-# /foo/" match to everying which starts
   wie "/foo/" including the trailing "/". If the directory
   "/foo" contain sub-directories only those sub-directories
   are included. If you specify "-# /foo" the directory "foo"
   including all sub-directories and all files starting wie
   "foo" in the directoty "/" are included.
