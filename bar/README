--- Installation

If there is no binary package available for your system,
install the packages from the following sources:

Install zlib:
  tar xjf zlib-1.2.3.tar.bz2
  cd zlib-1.2.3
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Install gcrypt:
  tar xzf libgpg-error-1.4.tar.gz
  cd libgpg-error-1.4
  ./configure
  make
  make install

  tar xzf libgcrypt-1.2.4.tar.gz
  cd libgcrypt-1.2.4
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Install gnutls:
  tar xjf gnutls-2.0.1.tar.bz2
  cd gnutls-2.0.1
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  ldconfig

Install ftplib:
  tar xzf ftplib-3.1-src.tar.gz
  cd ftplib-3.1
  patch -p3 < ftplib-3.1-1.patch
  patch -p1 < <BAR source directory>/ftplib-3.1-without-perror.patch
  cd ftplib-3.1/linux
  make
  cp libftp.a /usr/local/lib
  cp libftp.so.3.1 /usr/local/lib
  cp ftplib.h /usr/local/include
  cd /usr/local/lib
  ln -s libftp.so.3.1 libftp.so
  ln -s libftp.so.3.1 libftp.so.3
  ldconfig

Install ssh2:
  tar xzf libssh2-0.18.tar.gz
  cd libssh2-0.18
  ./configure
  patch -p1 < <BAR source directory>/misc/libssh2-seek.patch
  patch -p1 < <BAR source directory>/misc/libssh2-keepalive.patch
  make
  make install
  ldconfig

Then install BAR with:
  ./configure
  make
  make install

--- Archive files and encryption

For encryption the algorithms of the gcrypt library are
used. The BAR archive files are not encrypted in a single
block, instead each stored file is encrypted. The archive
file structure is readable (an BAR archive is organized in
"chunks"; see archiv_format.def if you are interested in
details), thus everybody can detect e. g. how many files are
stored in the archive, but nobody except the owner of the
passphrase used for encryption can read the contents of the
files nor the file meta data, e. g. file names (as long as
the used encryption algorithm is not broken by someone).

For asymmetric encryption a pair of keys with hybrit
encryption is used: the file meta data and file data is
encrypted with a symmetric algorithmis, e. g. AES or Twofish.
The key for symmetric encryption is chosen from random data,
encrypted asymmetric with the public key and stored in
the BAR archive files, too. Those archives can only be
read when the private key is available to decrypt the
symmetric key. With asymmetric encryption BAR archives
can be created without knowledge of the password needed
for decryption.

--- DVD

For storing archive files on DVD an external program like
"growisofs" is needed which is actually writing data to a
DVD. BAR create the archive files in a temporary directory
and then call the external tool for burning the DVD. The
tool "growisofs" is recommented for storing archive files
directly on DVD. An ISO image can also be created first e.
g. with mkisofs. BAR support external pre- and
post-processing commands when creating an ISO-image and
burning a DVD. With these commands e. g. dvdisaster can be
integrated into BAR to create RS-protected backup DVDs.

The following external tools are needed with the default
settings of BAR to create an DVD:

- growisofs
- mkisofs
- dvdisaster
- eject
- nice

--- Graphical frontend

barcontrol is a graphical user interface for BAR. It is
written in Java with SWT (Note: the former version used
TclTk). To run the graphical user interface a Java
runtime environment V1.5 (JDK5) or newer is required.
To start the graphical user interface type in

  java -jar barcontrol-linux.jar

resp. (if jar is packed with launch4j into an .exe)

  barcontrol.exe

resp.

  java -jar barcontrol-windows.jar


barcontrol ask for BAR server and the login password
and then connect to the running BAR server either via
TLS or a plain socket connection. barcontrol can edit
jobs on a server, display the current status of jobs and
start or stop jobs.

To use barcontrol the BAR server daemon have to be
startet first. Either enter

  bar --daemon

or use the start-script 'barserver' from /etc/init.d.

Please note that for a TLS connection the TSL keys and
cerificate files have to be available.

If you want to use a ssh tunnel to connect to the bar server
connect the ssh tunnel to port number 38523 (plain
connection) or 38524 (TLS connenction). e. g:




Install Java, SWT, launch4j:

* Download Java JRE V1.5 (JRE5) from http://www.sun.com
* Install Java

In case you do not want to use the included SWT 3.4
in barcontrol-linux.jar or barcontrol-windows.jar and
use instead barcontrol.jar SWT have to be installed:

* Download SWT from http://www.eclipse.org/swt
* Install SWT to some directory

To start barcontrol with the installed SWT you have to
specify the path to the swt.jar file, e. g.

  java -classpath /usr/local/swt/swt.jar:barcontrol.jar BARControl

If a single executable file should be created the
barcontrol jar file can be wrapped with launch4j:

* Download launch4j from http://launch4j.sourceforge.net
* Install

Note: call configure with

  --with-launchj4-dir=<path>
