BAR - BAckup Archiver

Features

* can split archive files into pieces
* compress of data with zlib or bzip2 algorithms
* encryption with gcrypt algrithms (AES,TWOFISH etc.)
* fast file format: can find and extract single files
  without decompressing/decryption of the whole archive
* direct copy of archives to remote computer via SSH
  (SCP or SFTP)
* daemon-mode with control over plain and TSL network
  connection
* nice graphical frontend (written in TclTk)

Requirements

* Unix system
* PTHREADs library
* zlib library
* bzib2 library
* gcrypt library
* ssh2 library
* long long datatype (because of large files)

Installation

./configure
make
make install

Archive files and encryption

For encryption the algorithms of the gcrypt library are
used. The BAR archive files are not encrypted in a single
block, instead each file is encrypted. The archive file
structure is readable (an BAR archive is organized in
"chunks"), thus everybody can detect e. g. how many files
are stored in the archive, but nobody except the owner of
the passphrase used for encryption can read the contents
of the files nor the file meta data, e. g. file names (as
long as the used encryption algorithm is not broken by
someone).
