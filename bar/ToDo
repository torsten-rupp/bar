ToDo

- restore files with graphical frontend
- check if file date/permission/owner/group is correct
- internal pipeling of commands for e. g. repacking, remove/add encryption
- support ssh-agent (extend libssh2?)
- logfile
- incremental backups
- ssl server: check common name? 
- improve calculation for estimated rest time
- improve password quality checker
- static binary for simple install on client (it is a "server", but
  we call it client :-))
