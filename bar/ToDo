ToDo

- check if file date/permission/owner/group is correct
- internal pipeling of commands for e. g. repacking, remove/add encryption
- support ssh-agent (extend libssh2?)
- improve logfile
- ssl server: check common name?
- improve password quality checker
- novice/expert mode in barcontrol.tcl
- barconfig for creating/edit bar.cfg
- Windows port
- re-read configuration when modified
- configure band-width on run-time
- ACL
- send job from server to other server
- send-only ssh-login (possible?)
- clear internal performance arrays before next job is started
- avoid negative bytes/s in performance monitor
- multiple instances of backup threads
- check ssl certificates
- multi-threaded compression? multi-core usage
- store partitions which are mounted ("on-the-fly-freeze")
- md5 file check sum?
- support sparse file when restoring
- compile-info (what is included, which version)
- delete tempora ry image directory when writing dvd
- support for config reload with SIGHUP
- support lzo compression library
- support for rmt? (tape control tool)
- support xdelta compression
- barcontrol: file separator character
- rename archive.? -> archives.?
- remove "Function" in lists.h types
- barcontrol: change *gif -> *png
- option/command to clear cached pass phrases in bar server
- storage on Samba server directly
- sorrage on webdav server directly
- general handling of strings containing LF, CR..
- doc: min. password length for 3DES
- progress bar when writing CDs
- when writing a DVD do not write more data then given volume size, e. g. 4*1G<=4G, do not write 5*1G
- dvd: eject last disk
- schedule: add tag text which can be used in the archive file name
- add debug version to packages
- support SMB without mounting
- disable CTS in crypt and fill last block with random data: this avoid that the
  blocks are reordered because of CTS (block n and n-1 are exchanged!) and blocks
  must be written and read with identically buffer sizes! For writting single blocks
  CTS is not used anyway
- -pedantic -std=gnu99
- define max. number of concurrent connections to sftp/scp host
  including background index thread; pause index thread on demand
- execute VACUUM on database/enable auto-vacuum?
- combine full-backup and incremental-backup into new full-backup
- replace ftplib by curl
- limit used bandwidth when creating index (all data is transmitted?)
- add allocator of connection (ftp, scp, sftp) and limit number of connections
- pre/post-script in barcontrol
