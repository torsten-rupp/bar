Description: Archiver program for compressed and encrypted archives.
 BAR is backup archiver program. It can create compressed, encrypted
 and splitted archives of files and harddisk images which can be
 stored on a harddisk, cd, dvd, bd or directly on a server via ftp,
 scp or sftp. A server-mode and a scheduler is integrated for making
 automated backups in the background.
 .
 * create, list, test, compare and extract archives of files
   and disk images
 * fast file format: can find and extract single files
   without decompressing/decryption of the whole archive
 * full and incremental backup files archives
 * support for several file systems on disk images (ext, fat,
   reiserfs)
 * can split archive files into pieces
 * compress of data with zlib, bzip2 or lzma algorithms
 * encryption with gcrypt algrithms (AES,TWOFISH etc.)
 * asymmetric encryption with RSA
 * direct copy of archives to remote computer via FTP or
   SSH (SCP or SFTP)
 * can store archives on DVD (with external tools)
 * support pre- and post-processing of DVD images (e. g.
   for including functions of dvdisaster)
 * daemon-mode with control over plain and TLS network
   connection
 * nice graphical frontend (written in Java+SWT)
