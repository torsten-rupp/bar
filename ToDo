ToDo

- check if file date/permission/owner/group is correct
- internal pipeling of commands for e. g. repacking, remove/add encryption
- support ssh-agent (extend libssh2?)
- improve password quality checker
- Windows port
- re-read configuration when modified
- configure band-width on run-time
- send-only ssh-login (possible?)
- avoid negative bytes/s in performance monitor

- when writing a DVD do not write more data then given volume size, e. g. 4*1G<=4G, do not write 5*1G
- dvd: eject last disk
- disable CTS in crypt and fill last block with random data: this avoid that the
  blocks are reordered because of CTS (block n and n-1 are exchanged!) and blocks
  must be written and read with identically buffer sizes! For writting single blocks
  CTS is not used anyway
- -pedantic -std=gnu99

  including background index thread; pause index thread on demand
